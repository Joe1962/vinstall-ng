HOW TO GENERATE LILO.CONF IDEA
1) Populate the tabstrip in FrmLilo with all the OSs found in the system
2) let the usr customize each OS's append lines and other options?
3) Provide a button for the user to press when done. On this event, the following needs to happen
   * Run through each tab in the tabstrip and determine if the checkbox has been ticked on or off
      + if off, then exclude that entire section from the lilo.conf else
      - Generate a lilo.conf entry with the information in that tab
Hope this works.
For WINDOWS partitions (installations) simply list the install location
    (maybe look for WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 to be sure it's a real install)
    and do not offer any other options. just to include / exclude from the menu
