- Re-worked the language selection
  * Changed the listview for a columnview
    \- This will eliminate the need to create an array
        with a long list of languages. Instead, the installer will
	look in it's .lang dir and list all the .mo files, then it
	will populate the columnview using only the languages found.



-I added the non-gui config code to run in the BG when lilo window starts.
 this is how it is done in old installer. 
 we still need vhalswitch, ALSA-config(this should be done in xterm IMO), vxconf, hwinit??, and runlevel??.
 we can skip last 2 IMO
 I added code to mount all needed binds to liloconfig and stoppped mount/umount in root, and useradd.
