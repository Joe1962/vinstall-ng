To install, click on the <b><font color=\"#0000FF\">START</font></b> button below the VL logo. Use the buttons on the top row to return to a previous stage. If you have already installed VL and just need to use some of the rescue functions, head on over to the <b><font color=\"#0000FF\">Tools</font></b> button.\n</p><br>\n\n<center><h3><b>About:</b></h3></center>\n\n<p>\nVector Linux is a small, but full-featured and VERY fast, Linux operating system for x86 PCs, based on one of the original Linux distributions, Slackware.
