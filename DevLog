- Fixed combobox sizes in lilo setup form.
- Moved binding mount of /proc and /dev to it's own sub in MdlConfLIlo instead of the forms open() event
  This sub will get executed only if the user chooses to install/setup lilo and right before setting it up.
- FrmRootPass Eliminated message "Password is set". Will only display error message if passwords do not match.
- Fixed problem with tabstrip width in netconf window
