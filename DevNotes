ISSUES / PROBLEMS
* Embedding the vasmCC useradd.gambas module results in the installer trying to create user accounts
   on the running environment, not the resulting installation - THIS IS VERY BAD
* Positioning of the following objects in frmNetconf must be fixed to keep keep them from overlaping their lables to the left
    - combobox to select config method
    - textboxes for static IP settings.
        \- wireless settings section must be moved to the right if this happens
